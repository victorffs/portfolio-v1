One of the founders of WikiLab, a makerspace inside a WikiHouse (an open-source house cut on a CNC machine) at the [Federal University of ABC](https://www.ufabc.edu.br/), built using crowdfunding and the help of technology communities.
Currently I'm responsible for promoting talks, activities, and workshops on subjects related to technological and maker culture, such as free software initiatives, data science study groups, and retro-computing clubs.
