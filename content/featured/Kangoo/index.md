A healthtech company focused on pediatric care, using automation and technology to enhance communication and support through platforms like WhatsApp. I was responsible for setting up the cloud infrastructure and training, including managing [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) with [Portainer management](https://www.portainer.io/) and integrating it to the [WhatsApp API](https://business.whatsapp.com/products/business-platform?lang=pt_BR).
