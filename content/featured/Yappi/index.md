A technology company that developed an automated crypto trading application. I was responsible for developing an IP proxy infrastructure using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/pt-br/) on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=pt-BR), which was later used to automatically balance client requests to the [Binance API](https://www.binance.com/pt/binance-api).
